Random shell scripts and whatnot that I'd like to share.


- [multiping](README-multiping.md): Ping multiple hosts at once
- [mtr-report](README-mtr-report.md): Wrapper for mtr to make reports easier
- [openssl-create-self-signed-key](README-openssl-create-self-signed-key.md): Create a self-signed SSL cert automatically
- backup-evernote-to-dropbox: Does what it says. It will back up your Evernote notes to your Dropbox directory by way of pushing them to a git repo.
